Analysis of popular African music on Spotify
# Project description: 
This post is inspired by an article about popular podcasts in Kenya (https://nation.africa/kenya/newsplex/kenya-s-best-and-highest-earning-podcasts-3288260).I looked on Kaggle and found a dataset of African music on Spotify, most is from Nigerian artists so will refer to this data as the Afrobeats data set. Here are some plots from this data in R, access the code above. 

1. What is the most common genre in Afrobeats music?
The original data set has a field called "Popularity", starting from zero to the highesy 73. I chose to filter out all zero values. 
The histogram generated is below:
